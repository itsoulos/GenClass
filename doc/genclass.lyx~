\begin_layout Abstract
A genetic programming based method is introduced for data classification.
 The fundamental element of the method is the well - known technique of
 Grammatical Evolution.
 The method constructs classification programs in a C – like programming
 language in order to classify the input data, producing simple if – else
 rules.
 The paper introduces the method and the corresponding programming tool.
 Also, the method is tested on a series of datasets against other well known
 classification tools.

\begin_layout Subsection
The proposed algorithm 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The procedure of Grammatical Evolution has two major requirements: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The context free grammar (CFG) of the target language as expressed in Backus
 Naur Form (BNF ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The associated fitness function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CFG grammar 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $G=\left(N,T,S,P\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is a set of non terminal symbols, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is a finite set of terminal symbols with the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $N\cap T=\emptyset$
\end_inset

.
 The terminal symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is named start symbol of the grammar and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is a finite set of production rules in the form 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow a$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow aB,\ A,B\in N,\ a\in T$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grammatical evolution is a genetic programming procedure, but the chromosomes
 are not expressed in the usual for of parse trees but as vectors of integers.
 Each element of the vector stands for a production rule from the given
 BNF grammar.
 The procedure initiates from the start symbol of the grammar and iteratively
 produces the program string, by replacing non terminal symbols with the
 right hand of the selected production rule.
 The selection is performed in two steps: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The next element from the vector is taken (denoted as V).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The production rule is selected using the scheme Rule = V mod R, where R
 is the number of production rules for the current non – terminal symbol.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selection is executed iteratively until either a valid expression is
 produced or the end of chromosome is reached.
 For the second case the chromosome is considered as invalid and we can
 start over (wrapping event) from the beginning of the chromosome.
 If the maximum number of wrapping events has been reached, then the chromosome
 is considered as invalid.
 The BF grammar used in the software to create a classification program
 for a problem with two classes (0 and 1) is shown in figure
\series bold
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-grammar-used"

\end_inset


\series default
.
 The parameter D determines the dimensionality of the objective problem.
 The numbers in parentheses denote the sequence number of the corresponding
 production rule to be used in the chromosome production procedure.

\series bold
 
\series default
In the proposed technique the chromosomes are represented as sets of integers
 rather than in binary form.
 This representation was chosen to increase speed of the evolution.
 Each gene 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

 is defined as: 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}\in\left[0..255\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The upper limit 255 means that the maximum number of production rules in
 the grammar is 255 but this limit can easily change.
 For better understanding of the production procedure consider the chromosome
 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\left[10,65,12,31,28,9,8,6,10,6,2,0,1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 In table

 we list the steps of producing a valid classification program using the
 grammar of two classes in

 The first

 The rest of the chromosomes are produced using the crossover procedure.
 For every new chromosome two chromosomes (parents) are selected from the
 old population using tournament selection.
 The procedure of tournament selection has as follows: A set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N>1$
\end_inset

 randomly selected chromosomes is produced and the chromosome with the best
 fitness value in this set is selected and the others are discarded.
 Each new individual is produced from the two selected parent using the
 so - called one point crossover.
 During one point crossover the parent chromosomes are cut at a randomly
 selected point and their right-hand side subchromosomes are exchanged as

 Finally, the column GENCLASS denotes the average test error from the applicatio
n of the proposed method to the dataset.
 As it can be deduced from the results, the proposed can improve classification
 accuracy in the majority of the used datasets.

\begin_layout Standard
A software which implements a method for data classifications was introduced.
 The method is based on grammatical evolution and the software is designed
 to be portable.
 The software is entirely written in ANSI C++ and there is not any specific
 software requirement.
 Future versions of the software will include
